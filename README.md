# Financial Management App - Vichack 2024

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a part of Vichack 2024 hackathon under the topic of creating applications that impact daily decision making.\
Our financial management app focuses on two key features to help users better track their spending and make informed financial decisions on the go based on their income, expenses and personal saving goals.

## Key Features
## Expense Tracking Page

The expense tracking page is designed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their financial situation through the following components:

## Visualization of Income and Expenses:

The page includes two graphs:
A line chart that tracks the user's income and expenses over time.\
A pie chart that gives a visual breakdown of expenses on certain spending categories and income.

The page also include an expense input form:
The form allows users to easily input their income or expenses. the form allows for real-time pdates to the charts and the budget analysis, ensuring users have up-to-date insights into their financial spendings.

The page then includes budget analysis:
This budget analysis is shown to the user if they have performed an analysis, if the user has yet to perform this action, it will provide a link that will direct the user to the Budget Analysis Page.

## Budget Prediction Model

The second feature of our app is a prediction model that estimates how much the user can afford to spend on a certain category based on the cost of living in different states in Australia.

Users are prompted to choose the categories they tend to spend the most on.\
They can also enter their target savings, and the model will use this information to predict an ideal budget for each category.

## User Information and Database Integration

Additionally, we have integrated a user authentication system with secure login and sign up pages, allowing users to store and retrieve their financial data.\
The database stores user profiles and budget analysis details.
